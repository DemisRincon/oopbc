<!-- Describe your changes in detail -->
<!-- FIRSTPART -->
<!-- 
I develop the first part as it is requested:

Escribe una programa que dado un número entero (con un número arbitrario de dígitos), lo convierta en números tipo LCD utilizando el siguiente formato:

```
   _  _     _  _  _  _  _  
 | _| _||_||_ |_   ||_||_|  
 ||_  _|  | _||_|  ||_| _|  
 ```
(cada digito tiene una altura de 3 líneas)

I modify some things. I display the result it on a web app and not in a console, it has an input text so you can write the number, then the number is shown in two ways    
    First way: As you requested on ascci code    
    Second way: With a component styled on scss by me

Currently, I work as a front end developer, my main programming language is javascript and I'm specialized in React js, also I can use other several frameworks like next is, node, express, a little of reacting native and angular2 and tools to a complaint like redux, context APIThis project, in particular, is developed on Next js with React js, Hooks, and scss
